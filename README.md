<h1>QA Automation Engineer<a href="https://github.com/tikarobinson2"></a></h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
Iâ€™m a detail-oriented and quality-driven QA Engineer with a strong passion for ensuring exceptional user experiences and robust, bug-free software. With hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing, I specialize in identifying issues early in the development cycle to ensure smooth and reliable deployments. My expertise includes working with tools like Selenium, JIRA, RTM, and Postman, and I excel at writing comprehensive test plans, executing tests, and collaborating with development teams to resolve bugs efficiently.

My approach is always focused on delivering high-quality results while maintaining a user-centric mindset. Iâ€™m experienced in Agile and Scrum environments, where I ensure software meets both functional and non-functional requirements. My adaptability and constant pursuit of learning allow me to stay ahead of industry trends and contribute to process improvements in QA practices.

In my spare time, I focus on expanding my knowledge and enhancing my skill set. Currently, Iâ€™m working towards my ISTQB Test Automation Engineering certification. I enjoy collaborating with others to tackle challenges and find effective solutions. As someone who is highly organized and detail-oriented, I am always striving to improve and evolve both personally and professionally.
